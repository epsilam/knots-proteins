# Usage
Run `main.py` with Python 3, and a Wolfram Language Script will be automatically generated in the same directory. This script may be evaluated with Mathematica to produce the Gamma polynomial of the protein.
To configure, set the variable `PROTEIN_NAME` in `main.py` to the desired protein name as found on the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/).
Note: this program is only designed to work for proteins consisting of a single polypeptide chain.
